 <h3> Our Story</h3>
 <h4>"Our mutual friend pulled me aside and said, 'I don't want to get involved, but I'm about to leave and I thought you should know Carlos thinks you're hot.'"
"Our mutual friend pulled me aside at a holiday party and just said, 'I don't want to get involved, but I'm about to leave and I thought you should know Patrick thinks you're hot.' He left, but I stayed at the party and later Carlos asked me out that night. Six months later, I found out [the friend] had said the same thing to Carlos and he had made it all up because neither of us ever said anything! We've been together 4.5 years." Sarah, 25 </h4>
